defmodule WandererKills.Ingest.Boundary do
  @moduledoc """
  Boundary definition for the Ingest context.

  The Ingest context is responsible for fetching and processing killmail data
  from external APIs (ESI, zKillboard). It transforms raw external data into
  internal domain models and stores them using Core services.

  ## Responsibilities
  - External API client management (ESI, zKillboard)
  - Real-time data streaming (R2Z2)
  - Killmail processing pipeline
  - Data enrichment and validation
  - Rate limiting for external APIs
  - Historical data fetching

  ## Dependencies
  - Core: For storage, caching, error handling, and utilities
  - Domain: For killmail models and data structures

  ## Public API
  Only the following modules should be used by other contexts:
  """

  use Boundary,
    deps: [
      WandererKills.Core,
      WandererKills.Domain
    ],
